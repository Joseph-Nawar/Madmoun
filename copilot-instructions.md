# Madmoun Project Instructions

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Supabase.
- UI Components: Shadcn/UI (base), Magic UI (hero/visuals), Framer Motion (animations).
- Icons: Lucide React.

## Design Philosophy (The "Madmoun Vibe")

- **Theme:** "High-End Fintech Trust."
- **Colors:** Deep Emerald Greens (#059669), Golds (#D97706), and Slate Black (#0f172a). **NO GENERIC AI PURPLE.**
- **Aesthetic:** Glassmorphism (frosted glass cards), clean borders, "Bento Grid" layouts.
- **Context:** This is an Egyptian fintech for a competition. English UI, but culturally relevant (e.g., Currency is EGP).

## Coding Rules

1. **Visuals First:** Prioritize "wow" factor. Use `framer-motion` for page transitions and entry animations.
2. **Mock Data:** Hardcode realistic mock data (Arabic names, realistic EGP amounts) immediately. Do not build empty states.
3. **No 'Lorem Ipsum':** Use realistic marketing copy about "Escrow," "Trust," and "Secure Payments."
4. **Components:** Prefer small, self-contained components in `@/components`.
5. **Simplicity:** This is a PoC. Skip complex validation or edge-case handling unless requested.
